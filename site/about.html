      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Getiva Solutions is a US-based staffing and workforce solutions firm focused on IT staffing, consulting, and scalable talent delivery for organizations that demand quality and reliability.</p>
      <p>Our philosophy is simple: we get it done for you. We exist to remove the operational burden of finding, vetting, and placing talent—so you can focus on running your business. That means we own the execution: recruiting, compliance, and delivery are our responsibility, and we are accountable for the result.</p>
      <p>We were built to serve mid-market and enterprise clients who need a delivery partner they can trust: one that combines rigorous recruiting, clear processes, and a commitment to long-term relationships. Our team brings years of experience in technical recruiting, vendor management, and project delivery—so we understand both the client and the candidate side of the equation.</p>
      <p>We do not compete on price alone. We compete on quality of talent, speed of delivery, compliance readiness, and the strength of our partnerships. That approach has earned us lasting relationships with clients across financial services, healthcare, technology, retail, and manufacturing.</p>

      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p>To deliver workforce solutions that help our clients achieve their goals through the right talent—placed quickly, managed professionally, and supported by a partner who gets it done so they can rely on us.</p>

      <h2>Values</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Integrity</strong> — We communicate clearly, honor our commitments, and treat clients and candidates with respect.</li>
        <li><strong>Quality</strong> — We focus on fit, skills, and performance. Quality of placement matters more than volume.</li>
        <li><strong>Partnership</strong> — We invest in understanding your needs and your culture so we can deliver and scale with you over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Accountability</strong> — We own our process, our communication, and our results.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Companies Trust Us</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Proven delivery</strong> — We have a track record of filling critical IT roles and supporting large programs and vendor agreements.</li>
        <li><strong>Enterprise-ready</strong> — We work within MSP and vendor programs, meet compliance requirements, and provide the documentation and controls that procurement and vendor management expect.</li>
        <li><strong>Stable, professional engagement</strong> — Consistent points of contact, clear SLAs, and a focus on long-term relationships rather than transactional deals.</li>
        <li><strong>Candidate care</strong> — We treat candidates fairly and professionally, which improves retention and reflects well on your employer brand.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Delivery Model & Industry Expertise</h2>
      <p>We combine a structured recruiting process with industry and technical knowledge. Our recruiters understand the roles they fill and the sectors we serve—so requirements are interpreted correctly and candidates are matched for both skill and fit.</p>
      <p>We support:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contract, contract-to-hire, and direct hire</strong> placements.</li>
        <li><strong>Project-based teams</strong> and statement-of-work engagements.</li>
        <li><strong>Vendor and MSP programs</strong> with the paperwork, reporting, and governance that enterprise clients require.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Our industry focus includes financial services, healthcare, technology, retail and eCommerce, and manufacturing. We tailor our approach to the compliance, terminology, and pace of each sector.</p>
