## ABOUT US PAGE

### Page Title
About Getiva Solutions

### Company Story

Getiva Solutions is a US-based staffing and workforce solutions firm focused on IT staffing, consulting, and scalable talent delivery for organizations that demand quality and reliability.

Our philosophy is simple: we get it done for you. We exist to remove the operational burden of finding, vetting, and placing talent—so you can focus on running your business. That means we own the execution: recruiting, compliance, and delivery are our responsibility, and we are accountable for the result.

We were built to serve mid-market and enterprise clients who need a delivery partner they can trust: one that combines rigorous recruiting, clear processes, and a commitment to long-term relationships. Our team brings years of experience in technical recruiting, vendor management, and project delivery—so we understand both the client and the candidate side of the equation.

We do not compete on price alone. We compete on quality of talent, speed of delivery, compliance readiness, and the strength of our partnerships. That approach has earned us lasting relationships with clients across financial services, healthcare, technology, retail, and manufacturing.

## SERVICES PAGE

### Page Title
Services

### Introductory Paragraph

Getiva Solutions offers a full range of IT staffing, consulting, and workforce solutions for US-based organizations. Whether you need a single contractor, a full project team, or ongoing support within a vendor or MSP program, we are built to deliver with quality and compliance in mind.

---

### IT Staffing

**Contract staffing**  
Place technical talent on a contract basis for defined periods. Ideal for project work, seasonal demand, or filling gaps without a long-term commitment. We handle payroll, benefits administration, and compliance so you can focus on delivery.

**Contract-to-hire**  
Evaluate talent in role before converting to full-time. We manage the contract phase and support a smooth transition to direct employment when you are ready.

**Direct hire**  
Permanent placements for full-time roles. We source, screen, and present candidates; you make the hiring decision and onboard as your employee. Our process is designed for speed and fit without sacrificing due diligence.

**Summary:** From short-term contractors to permanent hires, we provide the engagement type that matches your need—with consistent quality and clear terms.

---

### Consulting Services

We provide consulting and advisory support to help you design and execute talent and project strategies. This can include:

- **Workforce planning** — Aligning talent strategy with project timelines and business goals.
- **Role definition and job architecture** — Clarifying requirements and levels so recruiting is targeted and scalable.
- **Process and vendor alignment** — Working within your MSP or vendor framework so engagements run smoothly and stay compliant.

Our consulting engagements are scoped to your objectives and delivered by practitioners who understand staffing, IT, and enterprise delivery.

---

### Workforce Solutions

Beyond single placements, we support broader workforce needs:

- **Volume hiring** — Scaling recruiting for large initiatives, rollouts, or geographic expansion.
- **Managed teams** — Providing and managing entire teams (e.g., development, QA, support) so you get capacity without building internal recruiting and management from scratch.
- **Flexible workforce design** — Mix of contract, contract-to-hire, and direct hire to match budget, timeline, and risk tolerance.

We work with you to design a workforce model that balances cost, control, and capability.

---

### Vendor & MSP Support

We are built to work inside enterprise vendor and MSP programs. We can:

- **Meet program requirements** — Background checks, compliance forms, insurance, and rate and terms alignment.
- **Integrate with your VMS/MSP process** — Submissions, approvals, and reporting in the format and systems your program uses.
- **Provide consistent performance** — Dedicated points of contact, clear SLAs, and regular communication so we perform as a reliable tier-one or preferred supplier.

If you are a vendor manager or MSP, we can support your clients with the same level of quality and compliance we offer direct clients.

---

### Project-Based Staffing

For defined initiatives with clear scope and timeline, we provide project-based staffing:

- **Statement-of-work (SOW) teams** — Assemble and manage teams for specific deliverables and milestones.
- **Fixed or variable team size** — Scale up or down as the project demands.
- **Single point of accountability** — One team, one contract, one relationship so you spend less time managing multiple vendors.

Ideal for implementations, integrations, migrations, and other time-bound technical work.
